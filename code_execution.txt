Code --> Global EC --> this

JS is Single Threaded    

EC : 1. Global EC
     2. Function EC
     3. Eval EC

Js code runs in two phase, one is Memoery Creation Phase also called as Creation Phase which allocates the space to the variables
and another pahse is Execution Phase which does the task of execution


eg.

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 2)



Steps for Code Execution:

1. Global Execution at very first is allocated into 'this'

2. Memory Creation Phase: Suppose we have val1 which will have 'undefined' at initial, val2 also have 'undefined'
        Add num variable after val1 and val2 will not have 'undefined' but will have definition
        result1 -> Undefined
        result2 -> Undefined
        The above given is cycle one

3. Execution Phase:
        val1 --> 10
        val2 --> 5
        addNum --> [Executional Context (New Variable Environment + Execution Thread)] --> Sand Box
        For each sand box there are again same phases for execution
        The Execution Context get deleted once it's work is over

        Call Stack for methods (LIFO)
